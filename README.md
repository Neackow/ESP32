# ESP32
Code for the ESP32 - Motor controller

It turns out that historically, I was to use an ESP32, but it was not well suited for my application. I am using now a Raspberry Pi Pico W, more powerful and working. Name not changed to avoid any kind of git problems.

Explain what are all the subfolders.
